## Cause
creature_rescue::status() (the countdown and the partner's "revive" line) went only into a console report. Nothing
on screen said a player was down, so a knockout looked like random survival.

## Fix
* The status line is drawn centred under the top bar: the downed player's countdown in red, the partner's "Revive
  <name>: stay close for 1.5 s" in yellow.
* The host tells everybody when a knockout starts: "<name> is down! Stand next to them within 30 s."
* A downed partner's off-screen / over-head arrow is red.

## When there is no knockout (a plain death)
A knockout needs exactly two players in the session (`duo`), the partner's state fresh (< 2 s) in the same world,
and the lethal hit through the creature damage hook. Otherwise (3+ players, the partner loading or in an editor)
the death is native. Within reach of a partner the older teamplay rescue may also pull the player up at once.
