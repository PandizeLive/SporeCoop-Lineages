## Cause
teamplay.cpp's pack regen (a partner within reach) set the health up every second whenever any health was
missing. Hunger drains a few hundredths of a point all the time, so the regen topped it up every second forever
and the game's heal effect played on both players (seen after fights at a nest, where players are hungry).

## Fix
The regen starts below 95% of max health and heals to full, then waits until the next real loss.

## Verification
Before: host hp 30.96 / 30.99 / 30.98 / 30.96 / 31.00 / 30.98 (topped up each second). After: 30.33 / 30.29 /
30.23 / 30.18 (hunger only, no heal).
