## Report
Owner (2026-11-13): "The spectating background isn't rounded on the corners I noticed. The arrows inside the yellow buttons aren't centered either. We'll need to do a quality check." Also seen in the check: a 12-character name ("CreatureHost") broke in two lines over the title.

## Root cause
Observed. Corners: sui::image of lineages_downed_panel returned null on TITAN's QA games while the tooltip, icon and toast images loaded: those games read Data\SporeCoop.package of the installed game (the registry's DataDir), a package of 2026-11-11 without the image, not the QA copy's Data folder; the code then draws its square fallback. The MSI's package (2026-11-12) has it: rounded there. Arrows: a button copied from the Co-op window's (sui::button_like) keeps that button's caption offset and borders: "<" and ">" sat about 5 px right of the middle. Name: the label between the arrows was 100 px wide at 800x600 (the box 220).

## Fix
coop_ui.cpp: the arrow buttons are empty and carry centred labels of their own (as GIVE UP), kept in front with it; a warning in the log says whether the game's package is an older one. coop.cpp draw_downed_hud: the box (and GIVE UP with it) grows with the name: about 11 px a character plus the arrows, 60% of the screen at most. tools/qa_win/msi.ps1 deploy copies build/SporeCoop.package too. No switch (layout).

## Verification
no-fail-run: layout, manual. Before: out/shots/fresh-box.png (TITAN: square, arrows right of the middle, the name in two lines). After: out/shots/downed-box-msi-vs-titan.png: the MSI rounded with centred arrows; TITAN centred arrows, "CreatureHost" on one line, GIVE UP as wide as the box, still square (the installed game's package is the owner's to update: a new installer or their OK). Not checked: Cell, Adventure, 1440x1080.

## History
- 2026-11-13: opened.
- 2026-11-13 (later): the owner: "The arrows look to be too low still. Can we maybe use the triangles? Make sure this is consistent." Every arrow button now shows a triangle of the Co-op window's font (U+25C4, U+25BA, U+25B2, U+25BC: the font has them) in the middle of the button: coop_ui.cpp add_arrow_button and sui::center_caption (no caption offset, even borders) for the downed box's two, the Co-op window's creation / give / space arrows and the chat's up / down; the arrows' overlay labels of the first fix are gone again. Seen: the MSI (out/shots/downed-box-final-msi.png: rounded, centred), TITAN's downed box and Co-op window (out/shots/coopwin.png). Found, not fixed: the Co-op window's player list breaks "CreatureHost (host)" in two lines (the name column is 130 px).
