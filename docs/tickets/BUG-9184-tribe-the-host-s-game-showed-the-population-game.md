## Report
Found in the 3A A check (2026-11-13, TITAN host on the worn DuoQAJiffStand copy, 3 players): the host's game showed "Alas! Your population has fallen below the minimum ... Bounce back in time" (out/shots/host-native-gameover-1418.png) from 14:18:00 until OK was pressed at 15:27 (`busy=cinematic,input_lock,paused`). The host's village had been wiped twice before (party wipes 14:15:56 and 14:17:31, the second "refresh waits"). No population event reached h_TribeMessage before it: the first one logged after it is at 14:18:33 (held; a villager back 2 s later, under the caption: BUG-0172 territory). After OK (a reload) 25 minutes of play brought no second one.

## Root cause
Not found yet. Inferred: the game over came by another route than message 05C80207 through TribalGame_HandleMessage (CD81F0). The build now logs every TRG_* cinematic with its caller ("tribe: cinematic ... started from"), so the next one names the route.

## Fix
<!-- what changed and why; the switch to turn it off for tests (coop.fix <name>) -->

## Verification
<!-- the test: FAIL without the fix, PASS with it, each with its lab run id (out/lab/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS);
     or a line `no-fail-run: <reason>` (docs only, regression only, not reproducible) -->
