## Cause
By design the Cell DNA is the party's, as the Creature pack's: DNAForFood(shared food) - spent, and the host's
spent (S+0x2C) is synced to the guests (wsync.cell_spent, BUG-0560). The guest's number dropped with no message.

## Fix
When a guest's spent DNA goes up from a partner's editor (set_spent_dna), its feed says "A partner spent N of the
shared DNA in the editor (M left)." Test command: `coop.pool dna spend <n>` (host).

## Verification
Host spend 5: both games food=204 earned=16 spent=5 budget=11; guest log "A partner spent 5 of the shared DNA in
the editor (11 left)."
