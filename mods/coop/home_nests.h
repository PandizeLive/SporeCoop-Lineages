// Roadmap phase 2 (BUG-9135, owner decisions 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 of docs/ROADMAP.md): every player's own nest.
//
// Host: each party seat that plays its own species gets a nest herd of that species (the game's own CreateHerd with
// its nest) 40-80 m from the host's home nest, with the host's nest's brain range, best friends with the party.
// The game fills, respawns and saves it like any nest; the seat's creature is archived with the save (an offline
// player's nest loads, the AI runs it, it can die out; it is made again when the player is back). When the host's
// species migrates, a seat's nest far from the new home is made again next to it (the old one stays, as the game
// leaves the player's own old nests). Each partner is told its own nest as its home (nest.cpp MSG_NEST kind 2): its
// game joins its copy of that nest herd and hatches and respawns there. A nest made while its player is online sends
// them the world again (their copy must hold the nest; an empty nest made on their side faulted the game's claim).
// A seat playing the host's species shares the host's nest.
