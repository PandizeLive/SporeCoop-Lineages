// BUG-9135: a persistent identity per player, the key of a founder seat across rejoins, reloads and new network ids.
//
// Network player ids are reused (the lowest free one) and a custom creature's shared key contains that id, so with
// more than one partner neither tells the host which founder village is whose after a rejoin. Every game keeps one
// random 64-bit id per Spore profile (SporeCoop\identity.bin next to EditorSaves.package); a guest sends it to the
// host right after each join (MSG_IDENTITY, u64). A partner of an older version sends none: 0, the founders fall back
// to the creature match they always used.
