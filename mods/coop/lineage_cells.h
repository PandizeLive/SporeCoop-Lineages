// BUG-9111 (roadmap 43): Lineages cells. Player cells appear in the Cell stage as NPC species, about one
// in four spawns of a native creature species takes a player cell's model (docs/re/cell.md#cell-lineage-cells).
//  - which cells: the host's own My Creations and Lineages Cache cells authored by a player in this
//    session, and with Foreign Creations on (BUG-9112) any other Cache cell; never a player's current cell
//  - the native species keeps its behaviour (.cell AI): a cell goes only onto a native species with the
//    same diet (its mouth), so a carnivore hunts and a herbivore grazes
//  - the host decides; every guest gets the cell's records before the host uses it (creations::host_cell_out)
