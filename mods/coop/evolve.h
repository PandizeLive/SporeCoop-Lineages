// BUG-9160 (owner decisions 2D, 2E, 2026-11-12): personal evolving in Creature with the game's own cocoon.
// The game ships a cocoon for creatures (PatchData / Spore_Game; ids are FNV-1 of the lower-case names): the
// animations (type EE17C6AD) gen_evolve_cocoon (curl in), gen_evolve_cocoon_hold (inside), gen_evolve_emerge (out;
// its event crg_cocoon_hatch) and the effects crg_cocoon_create (the sac forms), crg_cocoon_hold (a translucent glowing
// sac), crg_cocoon_hatch (it bursts); runtime 2026-11-12 (`coop.evolve fx`: made / none for a name).
// A player who goes into their own editor stays where they stood on every partner's game: their creature wraps into
// the cocoon and holds there while they edit, and comes out with the new body when they are back. docs/re/creature.md
// #creature-cocoon.
